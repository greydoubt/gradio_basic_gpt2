# Implementing a Gradio User Interface

## Course Introduction
  Have you thought about **why user interfaces (UIs) are important when building machine learning solutions?**
  
  
  Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI was talking about ChatGPT and said:
  
  "we had the model for ChatGPT in the API for ~10 months before we made ChatGPT... **I sort of thought someone (else) was gonna just build it**"
  
  By taking GPT3 and making it as easy to use and as familiar as texting a friend, the barrier to entry was removed for millions. 
  
  Users immediately saw how powerful the tool is, shared it, and **ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer application in the history of internet applications reaching 100,000,000** users in two months. 
  
  There are many similar opportunities to use these brand new tools to provide real value. To do so you will need an interface people can use without having to dive into code or deal with complex parameters. 
  
  Today we are going to introduce Gradio. 
  Gradio is an [open-source Python library](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) we can use to build demos right into a browser.
